# WeatherXv2
Simple weather app for iOS device

This application uses Swift UI for view and Core Data to persist fetched data. 

The application uses Core Location delegate to obtain current user location and show weather for location. All data is obtained from OpenWeatherMap API.

To get the app working correctly you need to obtain your API key and put it to Constants. swift file in a project. You can obtain your free API key here: https://openweathermap.org/
